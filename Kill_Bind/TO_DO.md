# TO DO LIST
* Make it functional
* Allow customisability while in-game
* Fix UI bug w/ Framerate Slider (haven't been able to reproduce it!?!?!?!) (edit: i fixed it by removing my UI and using LethalConfig)
* Re add mod compatibility (TurretHead and maybe others idk)
* fix the stuff with LethalConfig not updating, seems to be possible (on thunderstore LethalConfig page check section: Overriding display properties of items)
* config stuff
* (Once it's functional) Add back the ability to customise in the main menu
